# Ranked enumeration of Join Queries with Projection
This project shows how to perform ranked enumeration for join queries with projections efficiently.

## Programming Language and Datasets
The source code is written in C++ and the CMake file is included to show what compilation flags have been used. Two datasets, dblp and imdb, have also been provided. The format for these datasets is the following: each line in the file represents a tuple (a,b). The vertex id is used as the weight for the ranking function. The dataset and the query can be changed in the main.cpp file.
